@functools.cache
def load_nvidia_dynamic_lib(libname: str) -> LoadedDL:
    """Load an NVIDIA dynamic library by name.

    Args:
        libname (str): The short name of the library to load (e.g., ``"cudart"``,
            ``"nvvm"``, etc.).

    Returns:
        LoadedDL: Object containing the OS library handle and absolute path.

        **Important:**

        **Never close the returned handle.** Do **not** call ``dlclose`` (Linux) or
        ``FreeLibrary`` (Windows) on the ``LoadedDL._handle_uint``.

        **Why:** the return value is cached (``functools.cache``) and shared across the
        process. Closing the handle can unload the module while other code still uses
        it, leading to crashes or subtle failures.

        This applies to Linux and Windows. For context, see issue #1011:
        https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/issues/1011

    Raises:
        DynamicLibNotFoundError: If the library cannot be found or loaded.
        RuntimeError: If Python is not 64-bit.

    Search order:
        0. **Already loaded in the current process**

           - If a matching library is already loaded by some other component,
             return its absolute path and handle and skip the rest of the search.

        1. **NVIDIA Python wheels**

           - Scan installed distributions (``site-packages``) to find libraries
             shipped in NVIDIA wheels.

        2. **Conda environment**

           - Conda installations are discovered via ``CONDA_PREFIX``, which is
             defined automatically in activated conda environments (see
             https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/user-guide/environment-variables.html).

        3. **OS default mechanisms**

           - Fall back to the native loader:

             - Linux: ``dlopen()``

             - Windows: ``LoadLibraryW()``

           - CUDA Toolkit (CTK) system installs with system config updates are often
             discovered via:

             - Linux: ``/etc/ld.so.conf.d/*cuda*.conf``

             - Windows: ``C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\vX.Y\\bin``
               on the system ``PATH``.

        4. **Environment variables**

           - If set, use ``CUDA_HOME`` or ``CUDA_PATH`` (in that order).

    Notes:
        The search is performed **per library**. There is currently no mechanism to
        guarantee that multiple libraries are all resolved from the same location.
