# Continuous Integration

## Repository Customizations

The workflows in this repository use the `CI_CUSTOMIZATIONS_*` namespace for
GitHub Actions configuration variables that opt an alternative synchronized
repository into repository-specific CI behavior. This keeps the workflow logic
shared without hard-coding the names of private repositories into the public
source tree.

These variables are non-secret strings configured under
**Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables**.
An unset variable, or any value other than the literal string `true`, leaves
the customization disabled. Do not store credentials or other secret values in
these variables.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CI_CUSTOMIZATIONS_SECURITY_SUITE_ENABLED` | Disabled | Enables the NVIDIA Security Suite after its runner, Actions variables, and OIDC/Vault authorization have been provisioned for the repository. |

The canonical `NVIDIA/cuda-python` repository does not need this variable
because its standard workflow behavior is enabled directly. Before enabling a
customization elsewhere, document the repository-specific prerequisites and
verification procedure in that repository's own documentation.
