# Continuous Integration

## Checkout History

Use the default shallow checkout for jobs that only read files or test prebuilt
wheels. Source builds need complete commit ancestry and release tags so
`setuptools-scm` can derive each package's version.

For those jobs, use `fetch-depth: 0` with `filter: blob:none`. The checkout
action fetches complete ancestry for all branches and tags, while the blob
filter skips historical file contents. This avoids downloading the large
historical `gh-pages` contents discussed in issue #2197. Git retrieves file
contents as needed when checking out the requested commit.

CI change detection uses this full-history checkout for PR mirrors, so the
actual PR base branch is available when computing its merge base. Non-PR runs
need only a shallow checkout. PR-preview cleanup checks out its script
shallowly and fetches `gh-pages` separately when needed. Pathfinder release
preparation fetches its exact tag without requesting every other tag.

Git documents blob filtering in its
[clone reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---filterltfilter-specgt).
The pinned checkout action's
[`README`](https://github.com/actions/checkout/blob/3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1/README.md#fetch-all-history-for-all-tags-and-branches)
documents `fetch-depth: 0` for fetching all history, branches, and tags.

## Temporary Pixi Lockfile Maintenance Pause

Pixi lockfile freshness enforcement and automated refreshes are temporarily
suspended because of [Pixi #7215](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/issues/7215)
and [#7000](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/issues/7000). Repeated lockfile
operations can change the committed solution without converging, so a general
refresh is not a reliable repair.

The `CI: pixi lockfile freshness check` workflow still runs on every PR with its
existing `pixi lock --check (all workspaces)` check name. It succeeds with a
warning annotation and job summary explicitly reporting the suspension;
success does not mean freshness passed. The refresh workflow has no schedule.
Manual dispatch emits the same notice without solving dependencies, rewriting
lockfiles, pushing a branch, or creating a PR.

Manifest/lock consistency is not automatically enforced during this pause.
Necessary dependency changes require manual review and validation of the
affected manifests and lockfiles. Real source builds and tests continue using
`PIXI_FROZEN=true`, including nested `pixi run` calls, to build the checkout's
source packages against the committed dependency solution. The pinned Pixi
version and committed lockfiles are unchanged.

Re-enable maintenance only after a released Pixi passes both upstream issue
reproducers and repeated byte-stable update/lock/check cycles across all six
workspaces: the repository root, `cuda_pathfinder`, `cuda_bindings`, `cuda_core`,
`benchmarks/cuda_bindings`, and `benchmarks/cuda_core`. Verify both `pixi update
--no-install` and `pixi lock`, followed by repeated `pixi lock --check` commands,
converge to unchanged lockfile bytes. Then restore strict freshness checks,
scheduled refreshes, and `PIXI_LOCKED=true` in source-build CI.

## Repository Customizations

The workflows in this repository use the `CI_CUSTOMIZATIONS_*` namespace for
GitHub Actions configuration variables that opt an alternative synchronized
repository into repository-specific CI behavior. This keeps the workflow logic
shared without hard-coding the names of private repositories into the public
source tree.

These variables are non-secret strings configured under
**Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables**.
An unset variable, or any value other than the literal string `true`, leaves
the customization disabled. Do not store credentials or other secret values in
these variables.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CI_CUSTOMIZATIONS_SECURITY_SUITE_ENABLED` | Disabled | Enables the NVIDIA Security Suite after its runner, Actions variables, and OIDC/Vault authorization have been provisioned for the repository. |

The canonical `NVIDIA/cuda-python` repository does not need this variable
because its standard workflow behavior is enabled directly. Before enabling a
customization elsewhere, document the repository-specific prerequisites and
verification procedure in that repository's own documentation.
