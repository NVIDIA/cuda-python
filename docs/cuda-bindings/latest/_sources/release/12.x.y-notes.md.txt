# CUDA Python 12.X.Y Release notes

Released on MM DD, 20YY.

## Highlights
- Add bindings for nvJitLink. It requires nvJitLink from CUDA 12.3 or above.
- Add optional dependencies to wheels for NVRTC and nvJitLink
- Enable discovery and loading of shared library dependencies from wheels

## Wheels support for optional dependencies

Optional dependencies are added for packages:

- nvidia-nvjitlink-cuXX
- nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cuXX

Installing these dependencies with cuda-python can be done using:
```{code-block} shell
pip install cuda-python[all]
```

## Discovery and loading of shared library dependencies from wheels

Shared library search paths for wheel builds are now extended to check site-packages. This allows users to seamlessly use their wheel installation of the CUDA Toolkit with cuda-python.
