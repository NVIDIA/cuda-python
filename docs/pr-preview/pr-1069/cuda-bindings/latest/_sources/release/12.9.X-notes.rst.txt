``cuda-bindings`` 12.9.X Release notes
======================================

Released on TBD


Highlights
----------

* Automatic CUDA library path detection based on ``CUDA_HOME``, eliminating the need to manually set ``LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variables for installation.
* The Python overhead of calling functions in CUDA bindings in ``driver``, ``runtime`` and ``nvrtc`` has been reduced by approximately 30%.
* Updated the ``cuda.bindings.runtime`` module to statically link against the CUDA Runtime library from CUDA Toolkit 12.9.1.
* ``cyruntime.getLocalRuntimeVersion`` now uses pathfinder to find the CUDA runtime.


Known issues
------------

* Updating from older versions (v12.6.2.post1 and below) via ``pip install -U cuda-python`` might not work. Please do a clean re-installation by uninstalling ``pip uninstall -y cuda-python`` followed by installing ``pip install cuda-python``.
