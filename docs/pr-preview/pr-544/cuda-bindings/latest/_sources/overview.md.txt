Python plays a key role within the science, engineering, data analytics, and
deep learning application ecosystem. NVIDIA has long been committed to helping
the Python ecosystem leverage the accelerated massively parallel performance of
GPUs to deliver standardized libraries, tools, and applications. Today, we’re
introducing another step towards simplification of the developer experience with
improved Python code portability and compatibility.

Our goal is to help unify the Python CUDA ecosystem with a single standard set
of low-level interfaces, providing full coverage of and access to the CUDA host
APIs from Python. We want to provide an ecosystem foundation to allow
interoperability among different accelerated libraries. Most importantly, it
should be easy for Python developers to use NVIDIA GPUs.

## CUDA Python workflow

Because Python is an interpreted language, you need a way to compile the device
code into
[PTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html) and
then extract the function to be called at a later point in the application. It’s
not important for understanding CUDA Python, but Parallel Thread Execution (PTX)
is a low-level virtual machine and instruction set architecture (ISA). You
construct your device code in the form of a string and compile it with
[NVRTC](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvrtc/index.html), a runtime compilation
library for CUDA C++. Using the NVIDIA [Driver
API](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/index.html), manually create a
CUDA context and all required resources on the GPU, then launch the compiled
CUDA C++ code and retrieve the results from the GPU. Now that you have an
overview, jump into a commonly used example for parallel programming:
[SAXPY](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/six-ways-saxpy/).

The first thing to do is import the [Driver
API](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/index.html) and
[NVRTC](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvrtc/index.html) modules from the CUDA
Python package. In this example, you copy data from the host to device. You need
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/contents.html) to store data on the host.

```python
from cuda.bindings import driver, nvrtc
import numpy as np
```

Error checking is a fundamental best practice in code development and a code
example is provided.
In a future release, this may automatically raise exceptions using a Python
object model.

```python
def _cudaGetErrorEnum(error):
    if isinstance(error, driver.CUresult):
        err, name = driver.cuGetErrorName(error)
        return name if err == driver.CUresult.CUDA_SUCCESS else "<unknown>"
    elif isinstance(error, nvrtc.nvrtcResult):
        return nvrtc.nvrtcGetErrorString(error)[1]
    else:
        raise RuntimeError('Unknown error type: {}'.format(error))

def checkCudaErrors(result):
    if result[0].value:
        raise RuntimeError("CUDA error code={}({})".format(result[0].value, _cudaGetErrorEnum(result[0])))
    if len(result) == 1:
        return None
    elif len(result) == 2:
        return result[1]
    else:
        return result[1:]
```

It’s common practice to write CUDA kernels near the top of a translation unit,
so write it next. The entire kernel is wrapped in triple quotes to form a
string. The string is compiled later using NVRTC. This is the only part of CUDA
Python that requires some understanding of CUDA C++. For more information, see
[An Even Easier Introduction to
CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/even-easier-introduction-cuda/).

```python
saxpy = """\
extern "C" __global__
void saxpy(float a, float *x, float *y, float *out, size_t n)
{
 size_t tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
 if (tid < n) {
   out[tid] = a * x[tid] + y[tid];
 }
}
"""
```
Go ahead and compile the kernel into PTX. Remember that this is executed at runtime using NVRTC. There are three basic steps to NVRTC:

- Create a program from the string.
- Compile the program.
- Extract PTX from the compiled program.

In the following code example, the Driver API is initialized so that the NVIDIA driver
and GPU are accessible. Next, the GPU is queried for their compute capability. Finally,
the program is compiled to target our local compute capability architecture with FMAD enabled.

```python
# Initialize CUDA Driver API
checkCudaErrors(driver.cuInit(0))

# Retrieve handle for device 0
cuDevice = checkCudaErrors(driver.cuDeviceGet(0))

# Derive target architecture for device 0
major = checkCudaErrors(driver.cuDeviceGetAttribute(driver.CUdevice_attribute.CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY_MAJOR, cuDevice))
minor = checkCudaErrors(driver.cuDeviceGetAttribute(driver.CUdevice_attribute.CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY_MINOR, cuDevice))
arch_arg = bytes(f'--gpu-architecture=compute_{major}{minor}', 'ascii')

# Create program
prog = checkCudaErrors(nvrtc.nvrtcCreateProgram(str.encode(saxpy), b"saxpy.cu", 0, [], []))

# Compile program
opts = [b"--fmad=false", arch_arg]
checkCudaErrors(nvrtc.nvrtcCompileProgram(prog, 2, opts))

# Get PTX from compilation
ptxSize = checkCudaErrors(nvrtc.nvrtcGetPTXSize(prog))
ptx = b" " * ptxSize
checkCudaErrors(nvrtc.nvrtcGetPTX(prog, ptx))
```

Before you can use the PTX or do any work on the GPU, you must create a CUDA
context. CUDA contexts are analogous to host processes for the device. In the
following code example, a handle for compute device 0 is passed to
`cuCtxCreate` to designate that GPU for context creation.

```python
# Create context
context = checkCudaErrors(driver.cuCtxCreate(0, cuDevice))
```

With a CUDA context created on device 0, load the PTX generated earlier into a
module. A module is analogous to dynamically loaded libraries for the device.
After loading into the module, extract a specific kernel with
`cuModuleGetFunction`. It is not uncommon for multiple kernels to reside in PTX.

```python
# Load PTX as module data and retrieve function
ptx = np.char.array(ptx)
# Note: Incompatible --gpu-architecture would be detected here
module = checkCudaErrors(driver.cuModuleLoadData(ptx.ctypes.data))
kernel = checkCudaErrors(driver.cuModuleGetFunction(module, b"saxpy"))
```

Next, get all your data prepared and transferred to the GPU. For increased
application performance, you can input data on the device to eliminate data
transfers. For completeness, this example shows how you would transfer data to
and from the device.

```python
NUM_THREADS = 512  # Threads per block
NUM_BLOCKS = 32768  # Blocks per grid

a = np.array([2.0], dtype=np.float32)
n = np.array(NUM_THREADS * NUM_BLOCKS, dtype=np.uint32)
bufferSize = n * a.itemsize

hX = np.random.rand(n).astype(dtype=np.float32)
hY = np.random.rand(n).astype(dtype=np.float32)
hOut = np.zeros(n).astype(dtype=np.float32)
```

With the input data `a`, `x`, and `y` created for the SAXPY transform device,
resources must be allocated to store the data using `cuMemAlloc`. To allow for
more overlap between compute and data movement, use the asynchronous function
`cuMemcpyHtoDAsync`. It returns control to the CPU immediately following command
execution.

Python doesn’t have a natural concept of pointers, yet `cuMemcpyHtoDAsync` expects
`void*`. Therefore, `XX.ctypes.data` retrieves the pointer value associated with
XX.

```python
dXclass = checkCudaErrors(driver.cuMemAlloc(bufferSize))
dYclass = checkCudaErrors(driver.cuMemAlloc(bufferSize))
dOutclass = checkCudaErrors(driver.cuMemAlloc(bufferSize))

stream = checkCudaErrors(driver.cuStreamCreate(0))

checkCudaErrors(driver.cuMemcpyHtoDAsync(
   dXclass, hX.ctypes.data, bufferSize, stream
))
checkCudaErrors(driver.cuMemcpyHtoDAsync(
   dYclass, hY.ctypes.data, bufferSize, stream
))
```

With data prep and resources allocation finished, the kernel is ready to be
launched. To pass the location of the data on the device to the kernel execution
configuration, you must retrieve the device pointer. In the following code
example, `int(dXclass)` retries the pointer value of `dXclass`, which is
`CUdeviceptr`, and assigns a memory size to store this value using `np.array`.

Like `cuMemcpyHtoDAsync`, `cuLaunchKernel` expects `void**` in the argument list. In
the earlier code example, it creates `void**` by grabbing the `void*` value of each
individual argument and placing them into its own contiguous memory.

```python
# The following code example is not intuitive 
# Subject to change in a future release
dX = np.array([int(dXclass)], dtype=np.uint64)
dY = np.array([int(dYclass)], dtype=np.uint64)
dOut = np.array([int(dOutclass)], dtype=np.uint64)

args = [a, dX, dY, dOut, n]
args = np.array([arg.ctypes.data for arg in args], dtype=np.uint64)
```

Now the kernel can be launched:

```python
checkCudaErrors(driver.cuLaunchKernel(
   kernel,
   NUM_BLOCKS,  # grid x dim
   1,  # grid y dim
   1,  # grid z dim
   NUM_THREADS,  # block x dim
   1,  # block y dim
   1,  # block z dim
   0,  # dynamic shared memory
   stream,  # stream
   args.ctypes.data,  # kernel arguments
   0,  # extra (ignore)
))

checkCudaErrors(driver.cuMemcpyDtoHAsync(
   hOut.ctypes.data, dOutclass, bufferSize, stream
))
checkCudaErrors(driver.cuStreamSynchronize(stream))
```

The `cuLaunchKernel` function takes the compiled module kernel and execution
configuration parameters. The device code is launched in the same stream as the
data transfers. That ensures that the kernel’s compute is performed only after
the data has finished transfer, as all API calls and kernel launches within a
stream are serialized. After the call to transfer data back to the host is
executed, `cuStreamSynchronize` is used to halt CPU execution until all operations
in the designated stream are finished.

```python
# Assert values are same after running kernel
hZ = a * hX + hY
if not np.allclose(hOut, hZ):
   raise ValueError("Error outside tolerance for host-device vectors")
```

Perform verification of the data to ensure correctness and finish the code with
memory clean up.

```python
checkCudaErrors(driver.cuStreamDestroy(stream))
checkCudaErrors(driver.cuMemFree(dXclass))
checkCudaErrors(driver.cuMemFree(dYclass))
checkCudaErrors(driver.cuMemFree(dOutclass))
checkCudaErrors(driver.cuModuleUnload(module))
checkCudaErrors(driver.cuCtxDestroy(context))
```

## Performance

Performance is a primary driver in targeting GPUs in your application. So, how
does the above code compare to its C++ version? Table 1 shows that the results
are nearly identical. [NVIDIA NSight
Systems](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems) was used to retrieve
kernel performance and [CUDA
Events](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-implement-performance-metrics-cuda-cc/)
was used for application performance.

The following command was used to profile the applications:

```{code-block} shell
nsys profile -s none -t cuda --stats=true <executable>
```

CUDA Python is also compatible with [NVIDIA Nsight
Compute](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute), which is an
interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It allows you to have
detailed insights into kernel performance. This is useful when you’re trying to
maximize performance ({numref}`Figure 1`).

## Future of CUDA Python

The current bindings are built to match the C APIs as closely as possible.

The next goal is to build a higher-level "object oriented" API on top of
current CUDA Python bindings and provide an overall more Pythonic experience.
One such example would be to raise exceptions on errors.
