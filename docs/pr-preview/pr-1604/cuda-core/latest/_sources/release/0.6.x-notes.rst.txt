``cuda.core`` 0.6.x Release Notes
=================================


Highlights
----------

None.


Breaking Changes
----------------

- Building ``cuda.core`` from source now requires ``cuda-bindings`` >= 12.9.0, due to Cython-level
  dependencies on the NVVM and nvJitLink bindings (``cynvvm``, ``cynvjitlink``). Pre-built wheels
  are unaffected. The previous minimum was 12.8.0.


New features
------------

None.


New examples
------------

None.


Fixes and enhancements
----------------------

- Reduced Python overhead in :class:`Program` and :class:`Linker` by moving compilation and
  linking operations to the C level and releasing the GIL during backend calls. This benefits
  workloads that create many programs or linkers, and enables concurrent compilation in
  multithreaded applications.
- Wheel and installed package sizes significantly reduced (e.g., on a typical Linux x86_64
  build, wheel from ~4.6 MB to ~1.6 MB and installed from ~26 MB to ~4.4 MB) by excluding
  Cython source files, generated C++ files, and other build artifacts from distribution
  packages.
