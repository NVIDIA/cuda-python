``cuda-bindings`` 12.8.0 Release notes
====================================

Released on January 24, 2025.

Highlights
----------

- Support Python 3.13
- Add bindings for nvJitLink (requires nvJitLink from CUDA 12.3 or above)
- Add optional dependencies on CUDA NVRTC and nvJitLink wheels
- Enable discovery and loading of shared libraries from CUDA wheels
- ``cuda-python`` is now a meta package, currently depending only on ``cuda-bindings`` (`see RFC <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/issues/105>`_)

Wheels support for optional dependencies
----------------------------------------

Optional dependencies are added for packages:

- nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12
- nvidia-nvjitlink-cu12

Installing these dependencies with ``cuda-python`` can be done using:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install cuda-python[all]

Same applies to ``cuda-bindings``.

Discovery and loading of shared library dependencies from wheels
----------------------------------------------------------------

Shared library search paths for wheel builds are now extended to check site-packages. This allows ``cuda-python``/``cuda-bindings`` to seamlessly use the aforementioned CUDA Toolkit wheels installed in the user's Python environment.

Known issues
------------

- Updating from older versions (v12.6.2.post1 and below) via ``pip install -U cuda-python`` might not work. Please do a clean re-installation by uninstalling ``pip uninstall -y cuda-python`` followed by installing ``pip install cuda-python``.
