``cuda-bindings`` 12.9.5 Release notes
======================================



Highlights
----------

* Added ``__cuda_stream__`` protocol support to ``driver.CUStream`` class, enabling better interoperability with libraries that expect this protocol.
* Python 3.9 support was dropped (end of life).

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed ``cuStreamBeginCaptureToGraph`` to allow the ``dependencyData`` argument to be optional, matching the underlying CUDA API behavior.

Known issues
------------

* Updating from older versions (v12.6.2.post1 and below) via ``pip install -U cuda-python`` might not work. Please do a clean re-installation by uninstalling ``pip uninstall -y cuda-python`` followed by installing ``pip install cuda-python``.
* The graphics APIs in ``cuda.bindings.runtime`` are inadvertently disabled in 12.9.3.  Users needing these APIs should update to 12.9.4 or higher.
