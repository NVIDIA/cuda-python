# CUDA Python 12.8.0 Release notes

Released on January 24, 2025.

## Included components

- [`cuda.bindings` 12.8.0](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-python/cuda-bindings/12.8.0/release/12.8.0-notes.html)


## Highlights

- Support Python 3.13
- Add bindings for nvJitLink (requires nvJitLink from CUDA 12.3 or above)
- Add optional dependencies on CUDA NVRTC and nvJitLink wheels
- Enable discovery and loading of shared libraries from CUDA wheels
- `cuda-python` is now a meta package, currently depending only on `cuda-bindings` ([see RFC](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/issues/105))


## Known issues

- Updating from older versions (v12.6.2.post1 and below) via `pip install -U cuda-python` might not work. Please do a clean re-installation by uninstalling `pip uninstall -y cuda-python` followed by installing `pip install cuda-python`.
