``cuda-pathfinder`` 1.2.0 Release notes
========================================

Released on Aug 29, 2025


Highlights
----------

* Reverse tabulated names to achieve new → old search order (`PR #921 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/pull/921>`_)

  - ``SUPPORTED_LINUX_SONAMES`` and ``SUPPORTED_WINDOWS_DLLS`` lists of DSOs are searched from new → old

* Support non-CTK Nvidia libraries (`PR #864 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/pull/864>`_)

  - Adds support for non-CTK Nvidia libraries: ``mathdx``, ``cufftMp``, ``nvshmem_host``, ``nvpl_fftw``

* ``RTLD_DI_LINKMAP``-based new implementation of ``abs_path_for_dynamic_library()`` (`PR #834 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/pull/834>`_)

  - Eliminates ``supported_nvidia_libs.EXPECTED_LIB_SYMBOLS`` entirely, providing major simplification
  - Step towards resolving library discovery issues
  - Includes minor fixes and cleanup

* Make ``add_dll_directory()`` and ``load_dependencies()`` side-effects more deterministic (`PR #855 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/pull/855>`_)

  - Improves stability in general and supports nvmath specifically
  - Proactive change to improve library loading consistency
  - Drops boilerplate docstrings for private functions
