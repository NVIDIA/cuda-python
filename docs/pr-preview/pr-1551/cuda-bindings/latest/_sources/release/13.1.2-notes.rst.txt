``cuda-bindings`` 13.1.2 Release notes
======================================

Highlights
----------

* Add ``nvFatbin`` bindings. (PR #1467 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/pull/1467>_)
* Performance improvement: ``cuda.bindings`` now uses a faster ``enum``
  implementation, rather than the standard library's ``enum.IntEnum``.
  This leads to much faster import times, and slightly faster attribute access
  times.  (`PR #1581 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/pull/1581>`_)

Experimental
------------

Bugfixes
--------

* Fixed an issue where the ``CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE_ORDINAL`` attribute was
  retrieved as an unsigned int, rather than a signed int.
  (`PR #1336 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/pull/1336>`_)
* Fixed ABI incompatibility bugs in cuFILE bindings introduced in v13.1.0.

Miscellaneous
-------------

* Wheel and installed package sizes significantly reduced (e.g., on a typical Linux x86_64
  build, wheel from ~16.6 MB to ~5.7 MB and installed from ~152 MB to ~23 MB) by excluding
  Cython source files, generated C++ files, and template files from distribution packages.

Known issues
------------

* Updating from older versions (v12.6.2.post1 and below) via ``pip install -U cuda-python`` might not work. Please do a clean re-installation by uninstalling ``pip uninstall -y cuda-python`` followed by installing ``pip install cuda-python``.
* The graphics APIs in ``cuda.bindings.runtime`` are inadvertently disabled in 13.0.2.  Users needing these APIs should update to 13.0.3.
