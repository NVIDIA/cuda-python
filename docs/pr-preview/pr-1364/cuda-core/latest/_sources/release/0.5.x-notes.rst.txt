``cuda.core`` 0.5.x Release Notes
=================================


Highlights

None.


Breaking Changes
----------------

None.

New features
------------

- Added :class:`PinnedMemoryResource` and :class:`PinnedMemoryResourceOptions` for managing
  host-pinned memory pools with optional IPC support.
- Added :class:`ManagedMemoryResource` and :class:`ManagedMemoryResourceOptions` for managing
  unified memory pools accessible from both host and device.

Fixes and enhancements

- Python ``bool`` objects are now converted to C++ ``bool`` type when passed as kernel

  with ``ctypes.c_bool`` and ``numpy.bool_``.
