``cuda.core`` 0.X.Y Release Notes
=================================

Released on TBD


Highlights
----------

- Fix for :class:`LaunchConfig` grid parameter unit conversion when thread block clusters are used.


Breaking Changes
----------------

- **CUDA 11 support dropped**: CUDA 11 support is no longer tested and it may or may not work with cuda.bindings and CTK 11.x. Users are encouraged to migrate to CUDA 12.x or 13.x.
- **LaunchConfig grid parameter interpretation**: When :attr:`LaunchConfig.cluster` is specified, the :attr:`LaunchConfig.grid` parameter now correctly represents the number of clusters instead of blocks. Previously, the grid parameter was incorrectly interpreted as blocks, causing a mismatch with the expected C++ behavior. This change ensures that ``LaunchConfig(grid=4, cluster=2, block=32)`` correctly produces 4 clusters Ã— 2 blocks/cluster = 8 total blocks, matching the C++ equivalent ``cudax::make_hierarchy(cudax::grid_dims(4), cudax::cluster_dims(2), cudax::block_dims(32))``.
- When :class:`Buffer` is closed, :attr:`Buffer.handle` is now set to ``None``. It was previously set to ``0`` by accident.


New features
------------

- Added :attr:`Device.arch` property that returns the compute capability as a string (e.g., '75' for CC 7.5), providing a convenient alternative to manually concatenating the compute capability tuple.
- CUDA 13.x testing support through new ``test-cu13`` dependency group.


New examples
------------

None.


Fixes and enhancements
----------------------

- Improved :class:`DeviceMemoryResource` allocation performance when there are no active allocations by setting a higher release threshold (addresses issue #771).
- Improved :class:`StridedMemoryView` creation time performance by optimizing shape and strides tuple creation using Python/C API (addresses issue #449).
- Fix :class:`LaunchConfig` grid unit conversion when cluster is set (addresses issue #867).
- Fixed a bug in :class:`GraphBuilder.add_child` where dependencies extracted from capturing stream were passed inconsistently with num_dependencies parameter (addresses issue #843).
- Make :class:`Buffer` creation more performant.
