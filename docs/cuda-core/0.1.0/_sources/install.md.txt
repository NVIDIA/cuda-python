## Runtime Requirements

`cuda.core` is supported on all platforms that CUDA is supported. Specific
dependencies are as follows:

* Driver: Linux (450.80.02 or later) Windows (456.38 or later)
* CUDA Toolkit 12.0 to 12.6


## Installing from PyPI

Coming soon!


## Installing from Conda

Coming soon!


## Installing from Source

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python
$ cd cuda-python/cuda_core
$ pip install .
```
For now `cuda-python` (`cuda-bindings` later) is a required dependency.
