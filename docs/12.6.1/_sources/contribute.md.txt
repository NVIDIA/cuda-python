# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CUDA Python! Based on the type of contribution, it will fall into two categories:

1. You want to report a bug, feature request, or documentation issue
    - File an [issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/issues/new)
    describing what you encountered or what you want to see changed.
    - The NVIDIA team will evaluate the issues and triage them, scheduling
    them for a release. If you believe the issue needs priority attention
    comment on the issue to notify the team.
2. You want to implement a feature or bug-fix
    - At this time we do not accept code contributions.
