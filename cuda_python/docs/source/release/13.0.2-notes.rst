CUDA Python 13.0.2 Release notes
================================

Released on TBD.


Included components
-------------------

* `cuda.bindings 13.0.2 <https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-python/cuda-bindings/13.0.2/release/13.0.2-notes.html>`_
* `cuda.pathfinder 1.1.0 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/blob/main/cuda_pathfinder/cuda/pathfinder/README.md>`_


Highlights
----------

* Migrated wheel dependencies from individual NVIDIA packages to the ``cuda-toolkit`` metapackage for improved dependency resolution and version constraints. This provides safer, more predictable dependency management similar to conda's ``cuda-version`` approach.

* All user-facing installation commands remain identical (``pip install cuda-python[all]``).


Known issues
------------

* Updating from older versions (v12.6.2.post1 and below) via ``pip install -U cuda-python`` might not work. Please do a clean re-installation by uninstalling ``pip uninstall -y cuda-python`` followed by installing ``pip install cuda-python``.
