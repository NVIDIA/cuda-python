Included components
-------------------

* `cuda.bindings 12.8.0 <https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-python/cuda-bindings/12.8.0/release/12.8.0-notes.html>`_

Highlights
----------

- Support Python 3.13
- Add bindings for nvJitLink (requires nvJitLink from CUDA 12.3 or above)
- Add optional dependencies on CUDA NVRTC and nvJitLink wheels
- Enable discovery and loading of shared libraries from CUDA wheels
- ``cuda-python`` is now a meta package, currently depending only on ``cuda-bindings`` (`see RFC <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/issues/105>`_)

Known issues
------------
