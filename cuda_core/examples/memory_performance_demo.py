"""
Performance demonstration for DeviceMemoryResource release threshold optimization.

This script demonstrates the performance improvement achieved by setting a higher
release threshold for the memory pool used by DeviceMemoryResource.

The optimization prevents the memory pool from immediately releasing memory back
to the OS when there are no active allocations, which can cause significant
performance overhead for subsequent allocations.
