# Contributing to CUDA Python

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CUDA Python! Based on the type of contribution, it will fall into two categories:

1. You want to report a bug, feature request, or documentation issue
    - File an [issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/issues/new)
    describing what you encountered or what you want to see changed.
    - The NVIDIA team will evaluate the issues and triage them, scheduling
    them for a release. If you believe the issue needs priority attention
    comment on the issue to notify the team.
2. You want to implement a feature or bug-fix
    - Please refer to each component's guideline: [`cuda.core`](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-python/cuda-core/latest/contribute.html),
    [`cuda.bindings`](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-python/cuda-bindings/latest/contribute.html).
