``cuda-bindings`` 13.X.Y Release notes
======================================

Released on TBD


Highlights
----------

* Migrated wheel dependencies from individual NVIDIA packages to the ``cuda-toolkit`` metapackage for improved dependency resolution and version constraints.
* Automatic CUDA library path detection based on ``CUDA_HOME``, eliminating the need to manually set ``LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variables for installation.


Dependency Changes
------------------

* The ``[all]`` optional dependencies now use ``cuda-toolkit`` with appropriate extras instead of individual packages:

  * Combined multiple CUDA toolkit components: ``cuda-toolkit[nvcc,nvrtc,nvjitlink,nvvm]==13.*``
  * ``nvidia-cufile; sys_platform == 'linux'`` â†’ ``cuda-toolkit[cufile]==13.*; sys_platform == 'linux'``

* User-facing installation commands remain identical (``pip install cuda-python[all]``).


Benefits
--------

* **Consistent dependency resolution**: More predictable version constraints through the ``cuda-toolkit`` metapackage
* **Simplified maintenance**: Single metapackage instead of managing multiple individual wheel versions
* **Cleaner dependency specifications**: Multiple related components combined into single dependency lines
* **Version safety**: Maintains support for CUDA 11.8, 12.x, and 13.x as designed


Known issues
------------

* Updating from older versions (v12.6.2.post1 and below) via ``pip install -U cuda-python`` might not work. Please do a clean re-installation by uninstalling ``pip uninstall -y cuda-python`` followed by installing ``pip install cuda-python``.
