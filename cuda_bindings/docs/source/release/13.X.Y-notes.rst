``cuda-bindings`` 13.X.Y Release notes
======================================

Released on TBD


Highlights
----------

* Migrated wheel dependencies from individual NVIDIA packages to the ``cuda-toolkit`` metapackage for improved dependency resolution and version constraints.
* Automatic CUDA library path detection based on ``CUDA_HOME``, eliminating the need to manually set ``LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variables for installation.
* The ``[all]`` optional dependencies now use ``cuda-toolkit`` with appropriate extras instead of individual packages. The NVCC compiler is no longer automatically installed with ``pip install cuda-python[all]`` as it was previously included only to access the NVVM library, which now has its own dedicated wheel. Users who need the NVCC compiler should explicitly install it with ``pip install cuda-toolkit[nvcc]==X.Y`` with the appropriate version for their needs.


Known issues
------------

* Updating from older versions (v12.6.2.post1 and below) via ``pip install -U cuda-python`` might not work. Please do a clean re-installation by uninstalling ``pip uninstall -y cuda-python`` followed by installing ``pip install cuda-python``.
