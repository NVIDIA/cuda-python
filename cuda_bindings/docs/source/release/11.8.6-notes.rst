# `cuda-bindings` 11.8.6 Release notes

Released on January 24, 2025.


## Highlights

- Support Python 3.13
- Add an optional dependency on the CUDA NVRTC wheel
- Enable discovery and loading of shared libraries from CUDA wheels
- `cuda-python` is now a meta package, currently depending only on `cuda-bindings` ([see RFC](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/issues/105))


## Wheels support for optional dependencies

Optional dependencies are added for packages:

- nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12

Installing these dependencies with `cuda-python` can be done using:
```{code-block} shell
pip install cuda-python[all]
```
Same applies to `cuda-bindings`.


## Discovery and loading of shared library dependencies from wheels

Shared library search paths for wheel builds are now extended to check site-packages. This allows `cuda-python`/`cuda-bindings` to seamlessly use the aforementioned CUDA Toolkit wheels installed in the user's Python environment.
