# `cuda-bindings` 12.8.0 Release notes

Released on January 24, 2025.


## Highlights

- Support Python 3.13
- Add bindings for nvJitLink (requires nvJitLink from CUDA 12.3 or above)
- Add optional dependencies on CUDA NVRTC and nvJitLink wheels
- Enable discovery and loading of shared libraries from CUDA wheels
- `cuda-python` is now a meta package, currently depending only on `cuda-bindings` ([see RFC](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/issues/105))


## Wheels support for optional dependencies

Optional dependencies are added for packages:

- nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12
- nvidia-nvjitlink-cu12

Installing these dependencies with `cuda-python` can be done using:
```{code-block} shell
pip install cuda-python[all]
```
Same applies to `cuda-bindings`.


## Discovery and loading of shared library dependencies from wheels

Shared library search paths for wheel builds are now extended to check site-packages. This allows `cuda-python`/`cuda-bindings` to seamlessly use the aforementioned CUDA Toolkit wheels installed in the user's Python environment.


## Known issues

- Updating from older versions (v12.6.2.post1 and below) via `pip install -U cuda-python` might not work. Please do a clean re-installation by uninstalling `pip uninstall -y cuda-python` followed by installing `pip install cuda-python`.
