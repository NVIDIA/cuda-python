``cuda-bindings`` 13.1.X Release notes
======================================

Highlights
----------

* Add ``nvFatbin`` bindings. (PR #1467 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/pull/1467>_)

Experimental
------------

Bugfixes
--------

* Fixed an issue where the ``CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE_ORDINAL`` attribute was
  retrieved as an unsigned int, rather than a signed int.
  (`PR #1336 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python/pull/1336>`_)

Known issues
------------

* Updating from older versions (v12.6.2.post1 and below) via ``pip install -U cuda-python`` might not work. Please do a clean re-installation by uninstalling ``pip uninstall -y cuda-python`` followed by installing ``pip install cuda-python``.
* The graphics APIs in ``cuda.bindings.runtime`` are inadvertently disabled in 13.0.2.  Users needing these APIs should update to 13.0.3.
