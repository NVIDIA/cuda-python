``cuda-bindings`` 13.1.0 Release notes
======================================

Released on Dec 4, 2025


Highlights
----------

* Add support for new APIs introduced in CUDA 13.1.
* The ``cufile.read`` and ``cufile.write`` functions now return the number of bytes read or written (``ssize_t``) instead of returning ``None``, providing better feedback on I/O operations.
* Improved performance of cuFile bindings with approximately 60x faster construction and member access for generated low-level classes.
* Added ``__cuda_stream__`` protocol support to ``driver.CUStream`` class, enabling better interoperability with libraries that expect this protocol.
* Upgraded Cython dependency to version 3.2.
* Python 3.9 support was dropped (end of life).

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed ``cuStreamBeginCaptureToGraph`` to allow the ``dependencyData`` argument to be optional, matching the underlying CUDA API behavior.

Backward incompatible changes
-----------------------------

Additionally, ``cufile.StatsLevel3.per_gpu_stats`` no longer returns a singleton that must be manually converted to a Numpy array, instead it returns a ``cufile.PerGpuStats`` array which is directly addressable.

Known issues
------------

* Updating from older versions (v12.6.2.post1 and below) via ``pip install -U cuda-python`` might not work. Please do a clean re-installation by uninstalling ``pip uninstall -y cuda-python`` followed by installing ``pip install cuda-python``.
* The graphics APIs in ``cuda.bindings.runtime`` are inadvertently disabled in 13.0.2.  Users needing these APIs should update to 13.0.3.
