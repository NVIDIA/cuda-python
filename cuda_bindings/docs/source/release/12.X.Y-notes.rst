``cuda-bindings`` 12.X.Y Release notes
======================================

Released on MM DD, 2025


Highlights
----------

* A utility module :mod:`cuda.bindings.utils` is added

  * Using ``int(cuda_obj)`` to retrieve the underlying address of a CUDA object is deprecated and
    subject to future removal. Please switch to use :func:`~cuda.bindings.utils.get_cuda_native_handle`
    instead.

* The ``cuda.bindings.cufile`` Python module was added, wrapping the
  `cuFile C APIs <https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/api-reference-guide/index.html>`_.
  Supported on Linux only.

  * Currently using this module requires NumPy to be present. Any recent NumPy 1.x or 2.x should work.

* Python bindings in every module, including ``driver``, ``runtime``, and ``nvrtc``, now have the GIL
  released before calling the underlying C APIs.

* The Python overhead of calling functions in CUDA bindings in ``driver``,
  ``runtime`` and ``nvrtc`` has been reduced by approximately 30%.

Bug fixes
---------


Miscellaneous
-------------

* Added PTX utilities including :func:`~utils.get_minimal_required_cuda_ver_from_ptx_ver` and :func:`~utils.get_ptx_ver`.
* Common CUDA objects such as :class:`~runtime.cudaStream_t` now compare equal if the underlying address is the same.


Known issues
------------

* Updating from older versions (v12.6.2.post1 and below) via ``pip install -U cuda-python`` might not work. Please do a clean re-installation by uninstalling ``pip uninstall -y cuda-python`` followed by installing ``pip install cuda-python``.
